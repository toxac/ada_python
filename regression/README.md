## Key Concepts

we can represent a simple linear regression line as $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$

Since regression analysis utilizes estimation techniques, there is always a level of uncertainty surrounding the predictions made by regression models. To represent the error, we can actually rewrite the equation to include an error term, represented by the letter 
ϵ (pronounced “epsilon”): $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \epsilon x$$.

There is one residual, also known as the difference between the predicted and actual value, for each data point in the dataset used to construct the model. We can then quantify how uncertain the entire model is through a few measures of uncertainty:

- **Confidence intervals** around beta coefficients
- **P-values** for the beta coefficients
- **Confidence band** around the regression line

You can refer to the glossary of terms to check any key terms and definitions, but we’ve provided the two key terms here:

- **Confidence interval**: a range of values that describes the uncertainty surrounding an estimate
- **P-value**: the probability of observing results as extreme as those observed when the null hypothesis is true
